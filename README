Blokus Web Application
----------------------

The aim of Blokus is to get more of your blocks down than your opponent.
Each piece has a different number of blocks ranging from one to five.
You start in the bottom left corner.
The two rules are that each new piece you place must be connected by a corner
to another one of your pieces and that your pieces cannot touch each other
along the edges.


To start a local blokus server run "node server.js".
Navigate to the url "localhost:3000" in order to access the web page.

From here you can login using new information or use the username "user" and
the password "pass" to access a current account.

When you create a game, you will be given a "gamecode" in the title, if the
game is against the computer then you can use this to come back to the game
later. If the game is against another user then they can input this gamecode
in order to join the same game.

If you create or join a game, when you log back you will be given the option to
rejoin the game using the hyperlink on the right.

If you choose a one player game then you will be given a semi-random computer
opponent to play against.


When in the game, select a piece from your pieces on the left, this will load
it into the piece viewer. From here you can change the piece's orientation so
you can place in on the board how you'd like. By hovering over the board you
get a preview of how it will look. Connect it to one of the green squares, a
move is shown to be valid once the background changes colour to green.

Once you can no longer move, click the "Can't move" button. Once both players
are finished the players will be notified and the resultant game data stored.
